excerpt: The Struggles During The Internship

### The Struggle

It's been three weeks since my internship started. The tasks for my internship is mainly implementing localization for Firefox Profiler. Everything seemed quite okay or doable before I started. But eventually the planning kinds of falls apart. Every plan is just a bubble of anticaptions that floats on top your head and when it's time to execute the plan, it kinda bursts!

The most common struggle I belive working from remote is managing the time. It's my first time working so I actually have no experinece balancing the work, academic, family and personal life. And I guess it's very common to get distracted while working from home.

I started doing the tasks, installing packages for the localizations and all then got stuck. Because some them were deprecated and the tutorials/docs about that were also obsolete for some cases. I really got tensed and was trying to figure out how to setup the packages. Looked for different resources or projects that is currently using the packages I need. My mentor helped by referencing me different project that are using the packages. But it was also hard to understand other project structure. So it took a while for me to figure out only the "Start" part of my internship task. If you lag behind when you are starting, it gets kind of scary right? I was doubting my capabilities, and also questioning if I really deserved this. The impostor syndrome got me.


### The Surviving

I have weekly video call with my mentor and it really helps me a lot. We talk about project work, difficulties and plan the week ahead. I asked him how he manages time. Well his answer really amazed me. He said he actually cannot manage the time too, as working remote can disrupt our scheduling. So I pull myself together and made a conclusion that everybody has their personal preference of 'Productive Hours'. 

About project tasks, he motivated me and assured me that it's all okay to take time. He gave me time to do my research and let the pressure off me. So I took things slow whenever it felt too much. I started to ask questions in the project chat even though it all may seemed really silly. It happens that sometimes you try so hard the easier solutions never cross your mind. I litreally took almost 3 week time when I anticapted it might take 1. Another thing my both my mentor and co-mentor suggested that taking rest is important. So I also took rest whenever I thought I needed. So eventually it all worked out. But that's just the end of the BEGINNING.

### The Struggle Continues..

Another struggle I'd like to mention is 'Blogging'. To be honest, I always wanted to write blog but never succeed. It always takes me hours to write 5 min blog. I find it very difficult to words for the things I feel and want to share.

### ..So Does The Surviving

Despite all these, the show must go on, right? The most crucial part is that whatever the struggle is we always have to find a way to tackle it and overcome it. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes don't. But we definitely gain experiences from it and we grow.
