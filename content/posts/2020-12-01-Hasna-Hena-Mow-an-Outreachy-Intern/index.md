## Introduction

Hello World! I'm **Hasna Hena Mow** from *Dhaka, Bangladesh*. I love to go by my pseudoname **`CipherGirl`**. I'm about to complete my undergrad from Dhaka City College as CS Major.

In my earlier academic years I was very fond of Competitive Programming. Later I diverted to exploring different fields in Tech industry. Earlier in 2020, I determined to build my career as Web Developer. Started my journey with freeCodeCamp ðŸ”¥.

During 2nd year I got scholarship to attend the worldâ€™s largest gathering of women technologists by *AnitaB.org* Instritute, **Grace Hopper Celebration**. The conference was held in Houston, TX, US in Sept 2018. I attended with all my expenses covered by *AnitaB.org* Instritute.

In 3rd year I participated in **Google CodeU 2019** (Asia Pacific), Student Program. It was more like a virtual pre-internship that allows students to program during a 12-week period and gain insider knowledge on how to secure a highly coveted paid-internship. This insider knowledge includes mock interviews, resume workshops and career sessions.

My undergrad life is almost finished (Stuck for COVID-19). Got another great opportunity, **Outreachy** internship @**Mozilla**. Hoping to put a beautiful end to my undergrad life with the amazing experience of working with **Mozilla**.

## My Core Values

### Initial Application

The initial application verifies your eligibilty, also considers your experience as minor or under-represented group in tech industry of your country. Remember It's purpose is to lessen the gender-bias or discrimination in tech industry. So if you ever felt as a minor in Tech, express properly in you initial application. Another thing important here is to ensure your work time availability. Interns are required to work 40 hours per week. So you need to make sure you don't have any time commitments during that periood. After getting approved initial application, you can now choose projects and start contributing for final application.

### Contribution Phase

Here comes the most **important** and **complex** phase! This phase requires some important steps to follow. Let me explain them for you.

#### 1. Project Selection

You have to find out the project that matches your skillset and fascinates you. This is where many people do mistake. The difficulty level of the projects varies depending it's company, it's tech, tools and architecture. The process can be overwhelming TBH. But you definitely have to keep your nerves calm and pick project that really excites you. You can select multiple projects. But this can be risky too. If you have a strong skillset you can go for multiple projects. If you are beginner I suggest you to stick to one, or chose beginner friendly projects. Even if you don't get selected you would definitely gain knowledge about contributing to Open Source, talking to mentors. In that case you have nothing to lose, and you can definitely come back stronger for next round (only 5-6 months away).

#### 2. Reaching out to Mentors / Joining Project Chat

This one is important! Now that you have selected the project reach out to mentor or join project chat group ASAP. You will feel confident to see yourself an early bird for that project. If you delay, you may see so many candidates introducing themselves, talking about issues, tools used in there and all. This maybe intimidating for you if you are applying for the first time. You might feel lost in the crowd.

#### 3. Contributing!

In the outreachy site you'll see your first time contributing guideline for each projects. These are set by mentors. So read them thoroughly before asking anything to mentor (They become super busy this phase, get lots of unnecessary questions too, try to avoid that). Ask them questions on specific topic, tool, or ask for help if you stuck on setting up the project. Do some research before you ask about anything. (They appreciate this)

Now that you have set up your project and have understanding of contributing, start contributing. And keep contributing till deadline. Even after that if you have unfinished tasks. Outreachy requires at least one contribution to be eligible for the final application and internship. But contributing more shows how much you are interested and reflects your skill level, how you handle several tasks. These are the things that mentor notices. And keep recording you contribution in outreachy site.

### Final Application

For submitting final application you have to record at least one contribution of each project. And there is some other fields asking about your experience open source software user/contributor. To avoid any sort of technical issues/faults submit final application at least 2-3 hours before the deadline time.

Now that you have submitted final application, you can still contribute and record them. You can also talk to mentor about your next move. Ask for suggestions if you need to learn about any tools used by the project. And finally the least favorite part **WAITING** for result.
